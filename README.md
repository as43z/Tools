# Tools, custom tools for my daily usage

Tools is a repository containing tools I have coded for my daily usage. None of
these tools are production-ready and furthermore, are designed for my use. Many
of them are proof-of-concept (POC) software pieces that are designed just for
fun.

## What is inside Tools?

Right now you can only find:
- [**envc**](environment_control/README.md), a custom environment control
variable manager. I use this tool in order to set up my environment variables
that are checked during session bringup or during installations.
